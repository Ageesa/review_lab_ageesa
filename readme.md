Stuffing Masala (To Be Ground Coarsely)
2 garlic minced 
¼ cup chopped coriander leaves 
¼ cup roasted peanuts + <li>
1tbsp chickpea flour
cup tightly packed grated coconut or ¼ cup unsweetened desiccated coconut
½ teaspoon cumin powder
½ teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)
¼  teaspoon garam masala powder
salt as required



Steps

Prep

Wash the bhindi and let it dry. I often use a paper towel to pat dry them. Then make a cut in each bhindi lengthwise without cutting through the entire length. They should still be joint at one end. Do this with every bhindi and then set them aside.
On a low flame, roast the peanuts, coconut powder and chickpea flour, till you smell the aromas and are starting to turn golden. Keep aside and allow them to cool.
In a grinder jar, add this mix of roasted peanut, coconut powder and chickpea flour along with 1garlic  and ¼ cup chopped coriander leave
To a large bowl add this mixture with, coriander powder, cumin powder, dried mango powder (amchur), red chili powder, garam masala, turmeric powder and salt.
Mix all the spices together with a spoon. Then add 2 teaspoons of oil to the stuffing and mix it well with the spices. The stuffing for the bhindi is now ready.
Take one bhindi and stuff it with the prepared masala. Repeat with the remaining bhindis. Make sure to stuff them well with a generous amount of masala. Set them aside.
 	
	 Cooking
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pan on medium heat. Place the stuffed bhindi in a single layer in the pan. After 2 minutes, lower the heat to medium-low and cover the pan.
After 2 minutes, open the pan and carefully flip each bhindi. Cover the pan again and flip the bhindi again after 2 minutes.
Keep tossing the bhindi after every 2-3 minutes or so until it's tender and done. This will take around 15 minutes on low heat.
Serve bharwa bhindi hot with roti or paratha. You can squeeze some lemon juice on top before serving for extra tang or also garnish with cilantro.
 
Notes
Cook on low heat and large pan. This allows okras to cook evenly
If you feel that the okras aren't dry but sticky, squeeze some lemon juice and let it cook till it dries.
